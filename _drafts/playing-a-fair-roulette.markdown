Let's define **fair gambling** as a game that changes the amount of money you have in an unpredictable way, but the *expected value* of the change is zero. An example of such a game is [Roulette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roulette) without the number zero. Or lottery, where 100% of collected money would be paid to the winners.

Why would you want to gamble? Because you may win some money, and then your life would be better: you would get *utility* out of the deal. How much utility would you actually get depends on the amount of many you already had. If you win $10,000, and you had just $1,000 saved up, that is of a great benefit to you. However, if you had $10M, the extra $10,000 don't change your life in any meaningful way. This is known as the concept of [diminishing marginal utility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_utility#Diminishing_marginal_utility).

We can define a utility function, which says how good our life is depending on the money we have.

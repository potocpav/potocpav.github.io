Let's define a **fair hazard game** as a game that changes the amount of money
you have in an unpredictable way, but the *expected value* of the change is zero.
An example of such a game is [Roulette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roulette)
without the number zero. Any [zero-sum game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_game)
that is based only on luck (say, betting on random events), is also a fair hazard game.

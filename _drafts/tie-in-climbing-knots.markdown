There has been some debate over the best tie-in knot over the years. The gist of it is very simple:
a re-threaded figure-eight is widely used, safe, but sometimes hard to untie. Therefore, some climbers
prefer various bowline variants: they are easier to untie, but the safety is often disputed.
In this article, I aim to comprehensively review the various tie-in knots to assess their safety and
other properties.

TODO: the last sentence of the abstract.

# Evaluation criteria

## Safety

**Safety** is the most important property of a tie-in knot. None of the reviewed knots capsizes when
properly tied, dressed, and loaded. Therefore, the potential for failure must be evaluated for non-standard
conditions. In other words, we shouldn't worry about the normal case. We *should* worry about what
happens if we are tired and distracted, if the partner forgets the partner-check, etc. That's
when accidents happen.

A good knot should therefore have these qualities:

1. It should be difficult to tie incorrectly.
2. It should be easy to visually inspect.
3. It should be robust under various loads.

There are instances of deadly accidents due to each of the above going wrong. **TODO**
